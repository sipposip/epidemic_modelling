# epidemic_modelling
This repository contains simple models for epidemics. The models are implemented as jupyter notebooks, and can be run interactively. 
Developed by Rodrigo Caballero and Sebastian Scher from Stockholm University, Department of Meteorology.

 
 ## Usage
 If you just want to use the models, you can directly
 launch the models on binder here [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sipposip/epidemic_modelling/master?urlpath=voila)
 (if you only see text but no plot-widgets, wait a moment, it can take some time to load.)
 
 direct link to models:
 * standard deterministic model [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sipposip/epidemic_modelling/master?urlpath=voila/render/SimpleEpidemicModel.ipynb)
 * probabilistic model [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sipposip/epidemic_modelling/master?urlpath=voila/render/mc_epidemic_model.ipynb)
 
 
 If you want to see (and modify) the code, you can launch the notebooks
 on binder here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sipposip/epidemic_modelling/master) 
 
 If you want to run the notebooks locally, you need to have all dependencies in environment.yml installed
 this can be done via anaconda via the command ```conda env create -n covid19-widget-env -f environment.yml```
